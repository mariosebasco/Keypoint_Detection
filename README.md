# First project for Udacity Computer Vision Nano Degree

## Facial Key Point Detection

The pbjective of this project is to build and train a CNN which takes in a face and produces a set of 68 key points defining important features in the face. Some examples include the eyes, the jaw line, points around the mouth and nose, etc. The images below show the reult of integrating the CNN with Haar cascades from OpenCV.
